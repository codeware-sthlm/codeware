## Startup Payload multi-tenant in dev mode

The Payload suite consists of

- Payload Admin UI (`cms`)
- Web Client (`web`)
- Docker Postgres Database
- Nginx Reverse Proxy to simulate multi-tenancy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For a better DX you should not connect to Infisical in dev mode, since the development seed has much more data.
>
> Make sure the credentials in the `.env.local` file are not set.

### Terminal 1: Start Postgres and admin UI

Start a Docker container

```sh
nx dx:postgres cms
```

Make sure database is in a fresh state (when needed)

```sh
nx payload cms migrate:fresh
```

Start the admin UI with live-reload

```sh
nx serve cms
```

:bulb: Database auto-seed will run

### Terminal 2: Start web client

> [!NOTE]
> Live-reload is not fully operational yet.

```sh
nx start web
```

### Terminal 3: Start reverse proxy

```sh
nx payload-proxy

# stop the proxy
nx payload-proxy:down

# or extended command to restart
nx proxy-cmd shared-util-payload restart
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can now access the different web sites as different tenants:
>
> **Admin UI** - Aimed for different maintainers  
> üåê `cms.localhost`
>
> :pouting_face: `system@local.dev` @ `dev`
>
> :pouting_face: `web-one.admin@local.dev` @ `dev`  
> :pouting_face: `web-one.user@local.dev` @ `dev`
>
> :pouting_face: `web-two.admin@local.dev` @ `dev`  
> :pouting_face: `web-two.user@local.dev` @ `dev`
>
> **Tenant 1**  
> üåê `web-one.localhost`
>
> **Tenant 2**  
> üåê `web-two.localhost`

## Development Tools & Services

### Infisical Secrets Management

The [Infisical](https://infisical.com) secret management tool is used to manage secrets for the Codeware ecosystem.

1. [Install Infisical CLI](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview#installation)

2. Login to access the secrets

   ```sh
   infisical login
   ```

3. List the development secrets

   ```sh
   # all secrets
   infisical secrets --recursive

   # cms application (all secrets and some by tag)
   infisical secrets --recursive --path /cms
   infisical secrets --tag cms

   # web application (all secrets and some by tag)
   infisical secrets --recursive --path /web
   infisical secrets --tag web

   # 'demo' tenant using web application
   infisical secrets --path /web/tenants/demo
   ```

#### Using the secrets <!-- omit in toc -->

Add Infisical creadentials to you local environment.

`apps/cms/.env.local`

```env
# Alt 1: Client credentials
INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID=
INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Alt 2: Service token
INFISICAL_SERVICE_TOKEN=
```

> [!NOTE]
> Secrets can also be injected into `process.env` for any command, but this is not how we normally do it.
>
> ```sh
> infisical run --path [path] -- [command]
> ```

### Fly.io Deployment

The [Fly.io](https://fly.io) platform is used to host the deployed applications and the required services.

Deployments are done automatically by the [nx-fly-deployment-action](packages/nx-fly-deployment-action) GitHub action, but it's still convenient to have the Fly CLI installed locally.

1. [Install Fly CLI](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

2. Login to your Fly account

   ```sh
   fly auth login
   ```

3. List the applications (for example)

   ```sh
   fly apps list
   ```

#### Database setup for preview deployments <!-- omit in toc -->

Applications affected by a pull request are deployed to a temporary preview environment.
To handle the dynamic nature of preview deployments, a Fly Postgres cluster is used to store the temporary databases.

For deployments to preview the applications will be attached to the Postgres cluster, and detached when the pull request is closed.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands are for reference and knowledge only!
>
> ```sh
> # Create a Postgres development cluster
> fly postgres create --name pg-preview --org codeware --region arn --vm-size shared-cpu-1x --volume-size 1 --initial-cluster-size 1
> ```

##### Connect to the database on local machine

Forward server port `5432` to local port `5433` to avoid conflicts with local Postgres running in Docker.

```sh
fly proxy 5433:5432 -a pg-preview
```

Connect with the following connection string:

`postgres://postgres:<password>@localhost:5433`

### Release Management

The release process is semi-automatic which means:

- Releases are generated from a local machine by a developer
- GitHub action trigger on the tags and publish to NPM

Simply run the following command to start the release process:

```sh
[pnpm dlx] nx release-cli
```
