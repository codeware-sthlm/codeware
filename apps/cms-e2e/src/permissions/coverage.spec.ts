/**
 * Permission coverage — every collection must be classified
 *
 * The specs in this folder probe hardcoded lists of collections. A collection
 * added to the config and to none of those lists is not safe, it is simply
 * untested, and the suite still goes green — which is how COD-425 stayed hidden.
 *
 * This asserts the lists still describe the running config, so a new collection
 * fails here until someone states what it is. Classify it below and add it to
 * the matching spec.
