 * What the public resolvers currently say about a domain, side by side.
 *
 * Kept apart from the certificate endpoint on purpose. That one talks to Fly
 * and answers in well under a second; this one waits on three dns queries and
 * an SOA lookup, and can be slow for reasons that have nothing to do with the
 * domain. Folding them together would make a sluggish resolver look like a
 * broken Fly check, which is the opposite of what this is for.
 *
 * Reads nothing and writes nothing — it only asks public resolvers about a
 * hostname the caller supplied. The `system-user` gate is there because the
 * latency is worth spending only for whoever is diagnosing a domain, not
 * because the answer is sensitive.
