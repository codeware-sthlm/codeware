/**
 * Request, re-read or withdraw the TLS certificate for a workspace domain.
 *
 * Certificates are the one part of a custom domain the platform owns: the
 * customer controls their dns, Fly issues the certificate, and neither can
 * finish without the other. This endpoint is the platform's half, driven from
 * the workspace's domains panel.
 *
 * Restricted to system users, matching who may edit a workspace at all. The
 * Fly token is org-scoped — it can attach a certificate to *any* app in the
 * organisation — so the app name is never taken from the request. It is read
 * from the stored domain row, which means a caller can only ever act on a
 * hostname a system user already wrote down against a specific app.
 *
 * Every answer is recorded on the row, including "there is no certificate".
 * The panel then renders without calling Fly, and the boot read that resolves
 * an app's own url has something to trust when it cannot call anything.
