/**
 * Serve the host cms on its own custom domain.
 *
 * The mirror of `adoptTenantDomains`, one level up: the host app's domain
 * lives in `platform-settings` rather than a tenant document, for the same
 * reason — the database is what the config is being built to reach, so this
 * runs from `onInit` instead of being read into `buildConfig`.
 *
 * Host mode only. A tenant deployment's own domain comes from its tenant row;
 * applying the platform's host domain there would put it on the wrong app's
 * identity, not just leave it unused.
 *
 * No spec, for the same reason `adoptTenantDomains` has none: importing this
 * file drags in `@codeware/app-cms/feature/domains`'s barrel, which re-exports
 * `guardDomainConflicts`, which imports `payload` as a value — and jest can't
 * parse Payload's ESM build. Covered instead by `nx verify cms` and manual
 * checks in the admin.
