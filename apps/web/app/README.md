## Routes

The `routes` directory contains all pre-defined routes for the application using Remix's file-based routing convention.

### Structure

Refer to

- [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes#route-file-naming)
- [Routing demo](https://remix-routing-demo.netlify.app/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All routes prefixed with `_dummy` are to be replaced with actual routes in the near future.
