 * Output build path limitation!
 *
 * We can force the output to be written to workspace root `dist` using remix config:
 *  buildDirectory: '../../dist/apps/web/build'
 *
 * However this makes the compiled property `assetsBuildDirectory` in `server/index.js`
 * point to the wrong path, and there is no way to override it (as I know it (Håkan)).
 *
 * Therefore we stick to output compiled code to app root until we know better.
