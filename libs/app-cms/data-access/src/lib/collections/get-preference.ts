/**
 * Read a single admin-UI preference blob by key.
 *
 * Payload stores each preference as one `payload-preferences` row per user,
 * keyed by `key`; access control scopes rows to the requesting user. Returns
 * the stored value cast to `T`, or `null` when absent or on any failure.
 *
 * Keys are user-writable, so callers own the value shape and should validate
 * it rather than trust the cast.
 *
 * Unlike the other collection readers, an unauthenticated runtime returns `null`
 * rather than bypassing access control: preferences are per-user, and the query
 * filters on `key` alone, so `overrideAccess` here would not widen the view to a
 * system one — it would just drop the scoping and hand back an arbitrary user's
 * row. Without an identity there is no preference to read.
 *
 * @param runtime - Authenticated Payload runtime or BasePayload instance
 * @param key - Preference key (e.g. `admin-dashboard`)
 * @returns Stored preference value cast to `T`, or `null`
