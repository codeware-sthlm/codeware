 * Utility to map a `BasePayload` to a `PayloadRuntime`
 * with `tenantConfig` set to `null`.
 *
 * `authenticatedUser` defaults to `null` (collection functions then bypass
 * access control). Provide `user` to get an authenticated runtime — e.g. in
 * admin server components where Payload supplies `payload` + `user` via
 * `ServerProps` and access control must apply.
 *
 * This is useful to keep a unified signature for collection functions
 * that can accept either an authenticated tenant with configuration or just the default payload instance.
