 * Which of a workspace's domains this deployment may actually serve.

 *
 * - **This app only.** One workspace can have domains on its web client and on
 *   its cms. Adopting another app's domain would make this one advertise a url
 *   it does not answer.
 * - **Issued certificates only.** A domain is added long before it works — that
 *   is the whole point of the dns instructions. Adopting one before its
 *   certificate exists would move every generated link and every password-reset
 *   email onto a hostname that fails TLS.
 *
 * `isPrimary` decides which url the app calls its own; the rest are still
 * answered, because a domain someone was moved off should keep working.
 *
 * @param domains - The workspace's domain rows
 * @param app - This deployment's Fly app name
