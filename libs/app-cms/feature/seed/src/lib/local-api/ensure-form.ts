/**
 * Ensure a contact form exists for the given tenant.
 *
 * One email field and nothing else: this sits at the foot of the home page as
 * a closing invitation, where anything longer than a single input stops being
 * an invitation and starts being paperwork. It also means every environment
 * has a form that really sends mail, so a broken mail setup shows up by using
 * the site instead of by reading logs.
 *
 * `emailFrom` and `emailTo` are deliberately left empty. `emailFrom` falls
 * back to the configured default sender, so the form needs no per-tenant
 * address and follows whatever transport the environment resolved — Mailpit
 * locally, Mailtrap on preview, SendGrid in production. `emailTo` falls back
 * to the tenant's generic recipient in site settings instead — seeded
 * alongside this form (see `ensureSiteSetting`'s `forms.notificationRecipients`)
 * so the two exercise that exact fallback rather than fighting it.
 *
 * @param payload - Payload instance
 * @param data - Form data
 * @param options - Seed options
 * @returns The created form or the id if one already exists
