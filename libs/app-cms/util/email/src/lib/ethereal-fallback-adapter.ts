/**
 * Last-resort development mail: a throwaway Ethereal inbox, made on demand.
 *
 * Ethereal accounts are disposable by design, which is exactly why the
 * credentials in a `.env` file go stale — someone has to notice and replace
 * them. Creating the account when the first message is actually sent removes
 * that chore: nothing to configure, nothing to expire, and no account made for
 * a boot that never sends anything.
 *
 * On demand rather than at startup on purpose. It costs a network call, and
 * paying that on every config load — including `generate:types` and every
 * migration — to support a mail nobody may send would be a poor trade.
 *
 * A local catcher (`nx dx:mail cms`) is the better daily loop: it works
 * offline and keeps its history. This is what you get when it is not running.
