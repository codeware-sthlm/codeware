/**
 * Make a transport failure loud instead of a line only `fly logs` sees.
 *
 * Every current caller of `payload.sendEmail` swallows its own rejection —
 * deliberately, since a form submission or a tour signup that reached the
 * database must not be undone by a mail provider being down. That leaves the
 * rejection with nowhere to surface: nothing downstream ever sees it (COD-288).
 *
 * Wrapping the adapter is the one place that can report every send without
 * touching each caller. It still rethrows, so a caller that does propagate
 * failures (Payload's own forgot-password flow, say) keeps deciding what
 * happens next — that path also reaches the config's `afterError` hook, so a
 * failure there is reported twice; accepted, since preventing it would mean
 * either silently swallowing here (masking exactly what this fixes) or
 * threading transport awareness into every caller instead of one adapter.
 *
 * Addresses are redacted on the way out. The form-builder plugin logs the full
 * recipient itself a moment later, so this does not make the address secret —
 * it keeps *this* report, which is the one that also reaches Sentry, free of
 * personal data that no diagnosis needs.
