/**
 * The browser never calls the cms api.
 *
 * Every client-side request goes to a route on the app's own origin, which
 * then reaches Payload server-side with the tenant api key. Two properties
 * rest on that, and both fail silently if it is broken:
 *
 * - **The api key stays on the server.** A browser call would have to carry it.
 * - **A tenant's custom domain is never a cors origin.** Adding a domain
 *   therefore needs no cors configuration anywhere — which is why the cms api
 *   can stay closed rather than being opened to `*`.
 *
 * `payloadUrl` in client code is fine for asset urls (`img`, `video`, download
 * links) — those are not cors-restricted. It is a `fetch` to it that is not.

 * url is not same-origin. A relative path always is.
 *
 * This is a tripwire for the shape, not a proof — `fetch(url)` built elsewhere
