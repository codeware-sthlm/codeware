 * Render the changelog for each released app.

 * No `CHANGELOG.md` is ever written — apps are not consumed by anyone, so a
 * committed changelog file has no audience and the branch is deliberately left
 * untouched by the release process. The contents are returned instead, and
 * `forceChangelogGeneration` is what lets nx render them without a file or a
 * remote release to write to.
 *
 * The range is nx's default: the app's last release tag up to `HEAD`. In a
 * preview lane that tag is the previous preview deploy, so the result reads as
 * "what this deploy adds", not "what this pull request adds".
 *
 * An app can be released with nothing to show. Selection follows the project
 * graph, but the changelog only lists commits that touched the app's own files
 * — so a shared lib or workspace config change deploys the app and renders an
 * empty changelog. Those are dropped rather than reported as "no changes".
 *
 * @param options - Released versions and whether to create GitHub releases
 * @returns Map of app project name to rendered markdown, skipping empty entries
