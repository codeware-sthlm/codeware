/**
 * Fly over its GraphQL API, without the CLI.
 *
 * A separate entry point because the two halves of this package have different
 * runtime requirements: the `Fly` class shells out to `flyctl` and reaches a
 * native pty module through `@codeware/shared/util/misc`, neither of which
 * exists inside an application image. Importing the root barrel to reach
 * `FlyApi` would pull all of that into the bundle.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the filesystem or spawns a process, so it runs anywhere
 * `fetch` does.
