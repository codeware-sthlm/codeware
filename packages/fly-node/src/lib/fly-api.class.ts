 * restarts, because a setting read at boot needs a boot to take effect.
 *
 * Fly splits those across two APIs and so does this class — certificates over
 * GraphQL, machines over the REST Machines API. One token authenticates both.
 * The split is Fly's; it is not hidden here, because the two have different
 * hosts and different failure shapes.
 *
 * Where this and the CLI can do the same thing the returned shapes agree, so a
 * caller can move between them. Where they differ, the API gives *more*:
 * issuance state and the DNS records to create come back as fields rather than
