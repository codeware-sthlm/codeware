## Prerequisites

- You have already created an Nx workspace
- Node 20+
- Docker is needed for some of the DX targets

> [!TIP]
> The commands in this readme assume that Nx is installed globally.
>
> ```sh
> nx [...]
> ```
>
> If you prefer not to, you can use your preferred package manager to prefix the commands like this example for `npm`.
>
> ```sh
> npx nx [...]
> # or
> npm run nx [...]
> ```

## Next.js Version

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin installs **Next.js v16** when generating a new Payload application, unless your workspace already has a Next.js version installed.

**Next.js v16 is not required — Next.js v15 still works.** The plugin installs Payload v3.86, whose `@payloadcms/next` package supports both Next.js v16 (`>=16.2.6`) and Next.js v15 (`>=15.2.9`). v16 is simply the new default for fresh installs.

### Can I stay on Next.js v15? <!-- omit in toc -->

Yes. If your workspace already has Next.js v15 installed, the generator **will not upgrade or downgrade** it — it only adds Next.js when none is present. Any Next.js version supported by the installed Payload release (`>=15.2.9`) is fine.

### Notes <!-- omit in toc -->

- Payload **v3.86** (installed by this plugin) is required for Next.js v16 support
- Next.js v16 builds with **Turbopack** by default; the generated `next.config.mjs` is compatible with it
- Next.js renamed the `middleware.ts` file convention to `proxy.ts` in v16 — the generated app follows the v16 convention

> [!TIP]
> See [this Payload PR](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/pull/14456) related to their work on supporting Next.js v16

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation is aimed for a **Payload v3** setup.
>
> To install **Payload v2** you should use plugin version **1.x**.

_Though it's possible to have applications using Payload v2 and v3 in the same workspace, it's not recommended. Payload v2 supports React 18 and v3 has moved to React 19. But with individual `package.json` files for the applications and some Dockerfiles `sed` magic it's possible to make it work._

### Add Payload plugin to an existing workspace

```sh
nx add @cdwr/nx-payload
```

### Inferred tasks

The plugin automatically generates Payload tasks for projects that has a `payload.config.ts` file somewhere in the project. The default location is in `{projectRoot}/src`.

- `gen`
- `payload`
- `payload-graphql`

> [!TIP]
> A couple of targets to improve [Developer Experience (DX)](#developer-experience-dx) are also generated:
>
> - `dx:mongodb`
> - `dx:postgres`
> - `dx:start`
> - `dx:stop`

### Configuration

Plugin configuration is added to `nx.json` by default.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "plugin": "@cdwr/nx-payload/plugin",
      "options": {
        "generateTargetName": "gen",
        "payloadTargetName": "payload",
        "payloadGraphqlTargetName": "payload-graphql",
        "dxMongodbTargetName": "dx:mongodb",
        "dxPostgresTargetName": "dx:postgres",
        "dxStartTargetName": "dx:start",
        "dxStopTargetName": "dx:stop"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Opt out from automatic inferrence <!-- omit in toc -->

To disable automatic targets generation and write explicit targets to `project.json`, use one of these two options:

- Set `useInferencePlugins` in `nx.json` to `false`
- Set environment variable `NX_ADD_PLUGINS` to `false`

## Usage

### Generate a Payload application

```sh
nx g @cdwr/nx-payload:app
```

### MongoDB, Postgres, Supabase or SQLite?

Payload has official support for database adapters [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org).

> [!TIP]
>
> [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) is set up using the Postgres adapter

Changing the adapter for a generated application must be done manually in `payload.config.ts`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We don't want to infer opinionated complexity into the Payload configuration. A new application is just a working template that you will customize and evolve to your needs.

Fortunately, changing the database is straightforward, and only a few parts need to be replaced.

```ts
// MongoDB @ payload.config.ts

import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb';

export default buildConfig({
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI
  })
});
```

```ts
// Postgres/Supabase @ payload.config.ts

import { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres';

export default buildConfig({
  db: postgresAdapter({
    pool: {
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URI
    }
  })
});
```

> [!TIP]
> More information can be found on the official [Payload Database](https://payloadcms.com/docs/database/overview) page.

## Developer Experience (DX)

The application come with a set of opinionatedtargets to improve developer experience. These targets are prefixed with `dx:` are optional to use.

> [!TIP]
> Display all the targets with extensive details for an application
>
> ```sh
> nx show project [app-name]
> ```

### Start Payload and database in Docker

This is the quickest way to get Payload up and running in no time.

Using docker compose, both MongoDB and Postgres are started in each container, as well as the Payload application.

```sh
nx dx:start [app-name]
```

Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to setup your first user.

#### Stop <!-- omit in toc -->

Shutdown database and Payload containers.

```sh
nx dx:stop [app-name]
```

Database volumes are persistent, hence all data is available on next launch.

### Start a local database instance of choice

You can also start the preferred database first, to be properly initialized before Payload is served.

#### MongoDB <!-- omit in toc -->

Run MongoDB in Docker

```sh
nx dx:mongodb [app-name]
```

#### Postgres <!-- omit in toc -->

Run Postgres in Docker

```sh
nx dx:postgres [app-name]
```

#### Supabase <!-- omit in toc -->

Supabase has its own powerful toolset running [local dev with CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

```sh
npx supabase init
```

```sh
npx supabase start
```

Edit `DATABASE_URI` in `.env.local` when needed.

### Serve Payload application in development mode

Payload application is served in watch mode.

> [!NOTE]
> The configured database must have been started, see [local database](#start-a-local-database-instance-of-choice)

```sh
nx dev [app-name]
```

Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.

### Run Payload commands

All commands available from Payload can be used for the application via targets `payload` and `payload-graphql`.

```sh
nx payload [app-name] [payload-command]
```

This is specially useful for managing [migrations](https://payloadcms.com/docs/database/migrations#commands), for example to check database migration status.

```sh
nx payload [app-name] migrate:status
```

### Generate TypeScript types and GraphQL schema

To provide a better developer experience for client development, the plugin can generate TypeScript types and GraphQL schema files from the Payload configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GraphQL schema will not be generated if `graphQL.disable` is set to `true` in `payload.config.ts`

```sh
nx gen [app-name]
```

The generated files are written to the `generated` folder.
The types can be distributed to the client developer manually or saved to a shared library in the monorepo.

> [!NOTE]
> The `gen` target is actually an alias for the following commands.
>
> ```sh
> nx payload [app-name] generate:types
> nx payload-graphql [app-name] generate:schema
> ```
>
> The generated app includes a `package.json` with `"type": "module"` to ensure the Payload config loads as ESM when running CLI targets on Node ≥ 20.11. If your workspace root `package.json` already has `"type": "module"`, this file is redundant but harmless.

### Troubleshooting

#### I can't get Payload to start properly with Postgres in prod mode <!-- omit in toc -->

Using Postgres in development mode enables automatic database synchronization with the Payload collections. But when starting in production mode it's turned off and the database is expected to have been setup with the collections. So when Postgres is started without a database, Payload will encounter errors.

The solution is to have an initial migration ready for Payload to load during startup.

##### Create a migration <!-- omit in toc -->

Make sure Postgres is running. Start Payload in development mode to setup your database with the collections.

```sh
nx dev [app-name]
```

Create a migration.

```sh
nx payload [app-name] migrate:create
```

Now Payload will run migrations automatically when starting in production mode.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The property `db.prodMigrations` in `payload.config.ts` must be set for this to work.

## You don't have an Nx workspace?

Just use the plugin sibling to get started from scratch.

See [`create-nx-payload`](https://github.com/codeware-sthlm/codeware/tree/master/packages/create-nx-payload/README.md) for more details.
