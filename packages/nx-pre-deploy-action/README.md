## Description

This action performs pre-deployment analysis for applications in an Nx workspace.

1. Determines the deployment environment based on the GitHub event
2. Analyzes which Nx applications that should be deployed
3. Optionally fetches app-tenant relations and secrets from Infisical for multi-tenant deployments

This action is intended to be used before the [Fly Deployment Action](https://github.com/codeware-sthlm/codeware/tree/main/packages/nx-fly-deployment-action#readme).

> [!NOTE] Deployment architecture and configuration overview
> How this action fits in the workflow.

> **See:** [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/codeware-sthlm/codeware/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Features

### Environment Detection

Automatically determines whether to deploy to `preview` or `production` based on:

- Pull requests → `preview` environment
- Push to main branch → `production` environment
- Fallback to empty environment, which should indicate a deployment can't be performed

Returned in `environment` output.

### Affected Apps Analysis

Uses Nx to determine which applications have been affected by code changes and should be deployed.

Returned in `apps` output.

### Multi-tenant Support

Optionally fetches tenant secrets from Infisical to enable multi-tenant deployments with per-tenant environment variables and secrets:

- Reads `DEPLOY_RULES` secret to determine which apps and tenants are allowed to be deployed for each environment
- Discovers tenant-app relationships from Infisical folder structure:  
  → `/tenants/<tenant-id>/apps/<app-name>/`
- Classifies secrets as **environment variables** (public, visible) or **secrets** (encrypted, hidden) using Infisical secret metadata:  
  → set `env` key to `true` for public secrets
- Each affected application is deployed once per tenant with isolated configuration when available

Returned in `app-tenant` output.

```json
// apps:
"api,cms,web"

// app-tenants:
{
  // 'api' left out
  "cms": [{ "tenant": "acme" }],
  "web": [
    {
      "tenant": "acme",
      "env": { "PUBLIC_URL": "..." },
      "secrets": { "API_KEY": "..." }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Environment Variables

The action sets environment variables that can be used in subsequent workflow steps:

- `DEPLOY_ENV`: Same as the `environment` output

## Multi-tenant Setup

To enable multi-tenant deployments with per-tenant configuration:

### 1. Infisical Folder Structure

Store secrets in Infisical using this structure:

```json
// applications with their secrets
/apps/<app-name>/<SECRET_NAME>

// tenants with their secrets !! MUST TEST THIS !!
/tenants/<tenant-id>/<SECRET_NAME>

// applications to deploy for each tenant with
// app-specific secrets
/tenants/<tenant-id>/apps/<app-name>/<SECRET_NAME>
```

**Example:**

- Applications: `api`, `web`
- Tenants: `acme`, `globex`

`web` is a multi-tenant application deployed for both tenants.

```json
/apps/api/PUBLIC_URL = "https://api.example.com"
/apps/web/PUBLIC_URL = "https://web.example.com"

/tenants/acme/apps/web/PUBLIC_URL = "https://acme.example.com"
/tenants/acme/apps/web/API_KEY = "sk_acme*"
/tenants/globex/apps/web/PUBLIC_URL = "https://globex.example.com"
/tenants/globex/apps/web/API_KEY = "sk_globex*"
```

**Hybrid Deployment (Single + Multi-tenant):**

Some apps may need to be deployed both as a tenant-scoped instance AND as a headless/default instance. Use the reserved tenant name `_default` for this:

```json
/apps/cms/DATABASE_URL = "postgres://..."
/apps/cms/PAYLOAD_SECRET_KEY = "..."

// Headless CMS deployment (no TENANT_ID set)
/tenants/_default/apps/cms/
// Optional: deployment-specific secrets for headless mode

// Multi-tenant deployments (TENANT_ID will be set)
/tenants/demo/apps/cms/
  PAYLOAD_API_KEY = "..."
  PAYLOAD_API_HOST = "demo.example.com"
/tenants/acme/apps/cms/
  PAYLOAD_API_KEY = "..."
  PAYLOAD_API_HOST = "acme.example.com"
```

The `_default` tenant is treated like any other tenant (respects DEPLOY_RULES), but the deployed app will NOT receive a `TENANT_ID` environment variable, allowing it to run in headless/default mode.

### 2. Classify Secrets vs Environment Variables

Use Infisical's **secret metadata** to control whether values are treated as environment variables (visible) or secrets (encrypted):

- **Environment Variable** (public, visible): Set metadata key `env` to `true`
- **Secret** (encrypted, hidden): Don't set the metadata, or set `env` to `false`

**Secure by default:** Everything is treated as a secret unless explicitly marked as an environment variable.

> **See:** [Secret Loading: Deployment vs Runtime](https://github.com/codeware-sthlm/codeware/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#secret-loading-deployment-vs-runtime)

### 3. Deploy rules

Create `DEPLOY_RULES` secret in the root path and add rules for each environment.

This way it's possible to have full multi-tenant deployments in production, but only a subset of apps and tenants in preview.

Rules can be specified in two ways:

#### Option 1: Metadata (preferred)

Add rules as secret metadata with `apps` and `tenants` keys. Infisical UI has native support for metadata, but it's only visible from secret details.

#### Option 2: JSON secret value (fallback)

Add rules as secret value in JSON format:

```json
{
  apps: string;
  tenants: string;
}
```

Example: `{ "apps": "*", "tenants": "*" }`

Use this when you rather want to see the rules in the secrets list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Either way, the rules must be valid otherwise an error is thrown

Rules format examples:

```yml
apps: '*'                  # all apps
apps: 'web,cms'            # only web and cms apps
tenants: '*'               # all discovered tenants
tenants: 'demo'            # only demo tenant
tenants: 'demo,acme'       # only demo and acme tenants
tenants: '_default,demo'   # headless deployment + demo tenant
```

> [!TIP]
> The reserved tenant `_default` must be explicitly included in `tenants` rules if you want it deployed. It's useful for preview environments where you might only want the headless CMS + one test tenant:

### 4. Provide Infisical Credentials

Add Infisical client ID, client secret and project ID as GitHub secrets. Use them for corresponding action inputs.
