 * import alone, so it can't be inferred — hence a maintained list. Entries
 * ending in `/` match by scope prefix; all others match by exact package name.

 * Internal libs are consumed by bundling their **source** — nothing consumes a

 * is disabled (COD-410). The one thing that model can't express is: "this lib
 * imports something esbuild cannot bundle, so it needs a manifest to externalize
 * it." Without it the failure surfaces at the wrong place — a consumer's esbuild
 * bundle dies with `No loader is configured for ".node" files` pointing into
 * `node_modules`, not at the lib that forgot its manifest.
 *
 * A second failure mode: a manifest missing `"type": "module"` makes node treat
 * the lib's files as CommonJS (the repo is ESM), so any `tsx`-run script
 * importing the lib's barrel dies with `does not provide an export named …`
 * (this broke `release-cli` and `pnpm cdwr`).
 *
 * This sync generator guards both: for each managed lib it ensures the manifest
 * exists, declares the un-bundleable deps (pinned to the versions resolved at
 * the workspace root, read from the project graph's external nodes), and always
 * carries `"type": "module"` and `"private": true`. `nx sync --check` fails with
 * an actionable message when out of sync; `nx sync` auto-fixes.
 *
 * Scope note (COD-416): this covers the **lib side** of the invariant. The
 * consumer side — reconciling each bundling consumer's `@nx/dependency-checks`
 * `ignoredDependencies` to list the internal libs it imports — is deferred
 * (Phase 2). It edits flat-config `eslint.config.mjs` files and is left
 * hand-maintained for now; the lib-side guard is where the confusing,
 * mislocalized failures actually originated.
