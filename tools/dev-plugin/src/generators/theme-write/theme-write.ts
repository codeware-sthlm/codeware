 * **Only the two token files.** `tailwind-base.css` is deliberately never
 * touched: the studio generates a fixed one, which would delete `codeware`'s
 * hand-written `@theme inline` brand block and `shadcn`'s baseline header. What
 * a theme declares beyond its tokens is not the studio's to rewrite.
 *
 * Nothing here validates the tokens. `nx sync` does that — `theme-sync` checks
 * every theme against the contract files and throws on a short one — which is
 * why the message below asks for it rather than repeating the check.
